# dots
All my personal config files. I use a colemak keyboard layout so this will be reflected in many of the dotfiles which define keybindings. I also use the Atom One Dark theme extensively throughout my dotfiles.

I own a Void Linux PC and an M1 Macbook Air so some dotfiles may be specific to these computers.
