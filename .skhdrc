# Modigie from 
#
# The following configuration heavily leverages modal keymaps to minimize the
# pollution of global keybindings. In addition, the modal keymaps facilitate
# the consistent use of the same keybindings across different modes. For
# example, this configuration uses 'h', 'l', 'j', and 'k' to represent west,
# east, south, and north when: changing focus, warping windows, resizing
# windows, swapping windows, and moving floating windows. Those four keys are
# mapped differently depending on the current mode to provide a consistent user
# experience.
# 
# Six different modes are provided in this configuration in addition to the
# default mode. The modes are tailored to their respective operations. Common
# operations are generally available without the need of any modifier keys.
# When modifier keys are used, they are for infrequent actions or size related
# actions. Entry into the modal system is via Ctrl - Space, which enters FOCUS
# mode. From there, any of the other modes can be activated with a single
# keypress.
#
# The following is a high-level summary of the keybindngs:
#

# this by sending keystrokes to mission control, but in order to do so, me must
# exit FOCUS mode, send the gloabl mission control keystroke, and then re-enter
# FOCUS mode, so we remain in focus mode. It's very likely that you'll want to
# change focus of windows after switching desktops, which is why we want to get
# back to FOCUS mode. Finally, due timing issues, we introduce a sleep as the
# standard mode commands are executed before mission control is done with its
# animation. Direct jumping to a window is faster than cycling through
# desktops, so the sleep delays are different.
